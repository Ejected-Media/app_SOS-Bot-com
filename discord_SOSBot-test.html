Embed Limits
To facilitate showing rich content, rich embeds do not follow the traditional limits of message content. However, some limits are still in place to prevent excessively large embeds. The following table describes the limits:
</div>

<div>
All of the following limits are measured inclusively. Leading and trailing whitespace characters are not included (they are trimmed automatically).
</div>
<div>
Field	Limit
title	256 characters
description	4096 characters
fields	Up to 25 field objects
field.name	256 characters
field.value	1024 characters
footer.text	2048 characters
author.name	256 characters
Additionally, the combined sum of characters in all title, description, field.name, field.value, footer.text, and author.name fields across all embeds attached to a message must not exceed 6000 characters. Violating any of these constraints will result in a Bad Request response.
</div>

<div>
Embeds are deduplicated by URL. If a message contains multiple embeds with the same URL, only the first is shown.
</div>

<div>
Embed Fields by Embed Type
Certain embed types are used to power special UIs. These embeds use fields to include additional data in key-value pairs. Below is a reference of possible embed fields for each of the following embed types.
</div>

<div>
Poll Result Embed Fields
Field	Description
poll_question_text	question text from the original poll
victor_answer_votes	number of votes for the answer(s) with the most votes

<div>
Users in Discord are generally considered the base entity. Users can spawn across the entire platform, be members of guilds, participate in text and voice chat, and much more. Users are separated by a distinction of "bot" vs "normal." Although they are similar, bot users are automated users that are "owned" by another user. Unlike normal users, bot users do not have a limitation on the number of Guilds they can be a part of.
</div>
<div>
<p>Names can contain most valid unicode characters. We limit some zero-width and non-rendering characters.
<ul>
<li>Usernames must be between 2 and 32 characters long.</li>
<li>Nicknames must be between 1 and 32 characters long.</li>
<li>Names are sanitized and trimmed of leading, trailing, and excessive internal whitespace.</li>
</ul>
</p>
</div>

<div><p>
The following restrictions are additionally enforced for usernames:<ul>

<li>Usernames cannot contain the following substrings: @, #, :, ```, discord</li>
<li>Usernames cannot be: everyone, here</li>

The easiest way for an application to share media to a channel or DM is to use the openShareMomentDialog command. This command accepts a Discord CDN mediaUrl (eg https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...) and opens a dialog on the discord client that allows the user to select channels, DMs, and GDMs to share to.

You can link directly to a specific SKU using our Application Directory Store URL scheme:
</p>
<p>
https://discord.com/application-directory/:appID/store/:skuID
</p>

<p>
When used in chat, it will render as a rich embed that allows users to launch a modal to view either the SKU details or checkout flow</p>
<p>
When used as a direct URL in a browser, it will take the user to your product in the Application Directory on web

<div><p>
When a user purchases a subscription, an entitlement is created. Entitlements represent the user's access to your consumable or durable item.</p>
<p>
Depending on your app's features, you can use a combination of Gateway events, the Entitlement HTTP API, and interaction payloads to keep track of user and guild entitlements and grant perks to users who have subscribed to your app.</p>

<p>
For apps requiring background processing or not solely reliant on interactions, keeping track of entitlements is essential. You can utilize the List Entitlements endpoint to list active and expired entitlements. Your app can filter entitlements by a specific user or guild by using the ?user_id=XYZ or ?guild_id=XYZ query params.</p>

<p>
For example, you might keep track of our entitlements in a database and check if a user still has access to a specific SKU before performing a cron job or other task.
</p>
<p>
Responding with a premium button gives you the ability to prompt users to subscribe to your app when they attempt to use a premium feature without a subscription.</p>
<p>
You can do this by sending a message with a button with a premium style and a sku_id that allows the user to upgrade to your premium offering.</p>
<p>
You can use the Subscription API to check on the status of your app subscriptions. This API allows you to list all subscriptions for your app for reporting purposes and to check on the status of subscriptions without having to access entitlements directly.
</p>
<p>
List SKU Subscriptions: List all subscriptions for a specific SKU in your app.</p>

<p>
Get SKU Subscription: Get a specific subscription in your app.
Subscription Gateway events: Discord will emit gateway events when a subscription is created, updated, and very rarely, deleted.</p>
<p>
If you'd like to test the full payment flow for your app, you can do so by interacting with your Store page or a premium styled button. Any team members associated with your app will automatically see a 100% discount on the price of the subscription, allowing you to purchase without the use of live payment method.</p>
<p>
After checkout, you will have a live subscription that includes a starts_at and ends_at value. If you cancel this subscription, it will remain an active entitlement until the ends_at timestamp. This subscription will renew until canceled and can be used in testing subscription renewals in your app.
</p>
</div>


<div><p>
SKU Types
For subscriptions, SKUs will have a type of either SUBSCRIPTION represented by type: 5 or SUBSCRIPTION_GROUP represented by type:6. For any current implementations, you will want to use the SKU defined by type: 5. A SUBSCRIPTION_GROUP is automatically created for each SUBSCRIPTION SKU and are not used at this time.</p>
</div>
<div><p><table>
<tr><th>Type</th>	<th>Value</th>	<th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>DURABLE</td>	<td>2</td>	<td>Durable one-time purchase</td></tr>
<tr><td>CONSUMABLE</td>	<td>3</td>	<td>Consumable one-time purchase</td></tr>

The poll object has a lot of levels and nested structures. It was also designed to support future extensibility, so some fields may appear to be more complex than necessary.

<div>
<p><b>Poll Object Structure</b></p>

<tr><th>Field</th>	<th>Type</th>	<th>Description</th></tr>

<div>
<p><b>Poll Media Object</b></p>
<p>
The poll media object is a common object that backs both the question and answers. The intention is that it allows us to extensibly add new ways to display things in the future. For now, question only supports text, while answers can have an optional emoji.</p>
</div>

<div>

<tr><th>Field</th>	<th>Type</th>	<th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>text?</td>	<td>string</td>	<td>The text of the field</td></tr>
<tr><td>emoji?</td>	<td>partial emoji</td>	<td>The emoji of the field text should always be non-null for both questions and answers, but please do not depend on that in the future. The maximum length of text is 300 for the question, and 55 for any answer.</td></tr>
</table>
</div>
<p>
When creating a poll answer with an emoji, one only needs to send either the id (custom emoji) or name (default emoji) as the only field.
</p>
<p>
<b>Poll Answer Object</b></p>
<p>
The answer_id is a number that labels each answer. As an implementation detail, it currently starts at 1 for the first answer and goes up sequentially. We recommend against depending on this sequence.</p>

<p>Currently, there is a maximum of 10 answers per poll.
