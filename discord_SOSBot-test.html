The easiest way for an application to share media to a channel or DM is to use the openShareMomentDialog command. This command accepts a Discord CDN mediaUrl (eg https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...) and opens a dialog on the discord client that allows the user to select channels, DMs, and GDMs to share to.

You can link directly to a specific SKU using our Application Directory Store URL scheme:
</p>
<p>
https://discord.com/application-directory/:appID/store/:skuID
</p>

<p>
When used in chat, it will render as a rich embed that allows users to launch a modal to view either the SKU details or checkout flow</p>
<p>
When used as a direct URL in a browser, it will take the user to your product in the Application Directory on web

<div><p>
When a user purchases a subscription, an entitlement is created. Entitlements represent the user's access to your consumable or durable item.</p>
<p>
Depending on your app's features, you can use a combination of Gateway events, the Entitlement HTTP API, and interaction payloads to keep track of user and guild entitlements and grant perks to users who have subscribed to your app.</p>

<p>
For apps requiring background processing or not solely reliant on interactions, keeping track of entitlements is essential. You can utilize the List Entitlements endpoint to list active and expired entitlements. Your app can filter entitlements by a specific user or guild by using the ?user_id=XYZ or ?guild_id=XYZ query params.</p>

<p>
For example, you might keep track of our entitlements in a database and check if a user still has access to a specific SKU before performing a cron job or other task.
</p>
<p>
Responding with a premium button gives you the ability to prompt users to subscribe to your app when they attempt to use a premium feature without a subscription.</p>
<p>
You can do this by sending a message with a button with a premium style and a sku_id that allows the user to upgrade to your premium offering.</p>
<p>
You can use the Subscription API to check on the status of your app subscriptions. This API allows you to list all subscriptions for your app for reporting purposes and to check on the status of subscriptions without having to access entitlements directly.
</p>
<p>
List SKU Subscriptions: List all subscriptions for a specific SKU in your app.</p>

<p>
Get SKU Subscription: Get a specific subscription in your app.
Subscription Gateway events: Discord will emit gateway events when a subscription is created, updated, and very rarely, deleted.</p>
<p>
If you'd like to test the full payment flow for your app, you can do so by interacting with your Store page or a premium styled button. Any team members associated with your app will automatically see a 100% discount on the price of the subscription, allowing you to purchase without the use of live payment method.</p>
<p>
After checkout, you will have a live subscription that includes a starts_at and ends_at value. If you cancel this subscription, it will remain an active entitlement until the ends_at timestamp. This subscription will renew until canceled and can be used in testing subscription renewals in your app.
